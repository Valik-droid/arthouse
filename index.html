            <div class="reviews__author">First of all, you need to decide on the type of resource and choose the one that best suits your short-term and long-term plans. At the beginning of the 21st century, the entire Internet consists of the following types of sites.

Blogs. Such resources are personal pages or industry pages, such as about tourism, fishing, or travel. Usually a blog is run by one person and its success, first of all, does not depend on design and SEO, but on the quality of graphic and textual content.текстового контенту.

E-commerce sites. These include online stores, order catalogs, bulletin boards, exchanges and other online commerce resources. A rare person alone can create a successful site of this type.

Resources with educational programs. Now this segment is developing rapidly - because video courses can teach literally any skills. If you have excellent knowledge in a popular field or a rare specialization, such a site will easily make you popular. Especially if you connect English subtitles to the flooded video.
Ресурси з новинами або агрегатори. Зазвичай створюються командою однодумців, які поділяють обов'язки. Швидко отримують дуже більшу кількість відвідувачів і живуть за рахунок розміщення реклами.

Online community. These include forums and social networks where people can chat and shop at the same time. Currently, the niche has virtually monopolized FB, VK and global industry forums-portals such as Habra

Portfolio. Are personal or business resources of technical support. They exhibit samples of work, such as landscaping, repair, graphics, handmade or technical projects.

It should be noted that the first method requires special knowledge from the user - programming languages HTML, PHP, JavaScript, CSS style sheets. Of course, information about all this can be found on the Internet and studied, but there are faster and easier ways. So let's focus on them.</div>

            <div class="reviews__author">Preparatory. The point is that we just create the files, folders we need, connect the libraries and frameworks we plan to work with, create a stylesheet, a file for web scripts, and so on. We just prepare everything to get started.</div>

             <div class="reviews__text">The second stage</div>
            <div class="reviews__author">Creating a grid. This is the framework of our site. The simplest version of the grid is traditionally considered to be: a header, the main content, a block on the right or left and the footer (bottom) of the page. In your layout, everything can be more complicated. In addition, the individual blocks contain other elements that you will also need to place. But that's later, and for now you just need to create a grid. The most popular grid options can be viewed on the htmlbook.
            To do this, you need knowledge in the field of creating and arranging structural elements on the page. For example, you need to know what tabular and block layout is, how you can set the width and height of elements, set the flow, etc. You need knowledge that can be gained in the process of learning layout. You will be able to receive the most complete knowledge in our course on layout techniques.</div>

             <div class="reviews__text">The third stage</div>
            <div class="reviews__author">Work with smaller elements. To continue the layout of the site, you need to deal with the location of other elements on the page. The grid is just a framework, which is created by an experienced layout designer in a couple of minutes. Then begins the main part of the work - to arrange all the elements so that they were exactly as in the layout.For example, the logo should be in the upper right corner of your header. You need to know how to put it there. And in this, again, our video tutorials on the basics of HTML and CSS will help you. If you plan to make a rubber layout of the site, then you will need to consider the features of positioning elements for it. To understand the behavior of rubber blocks, I recommend taking this practical course.</div>

             <div class="reviews__text">The fourth stage</div>
            <div class="reviews__author">Can be done in conjunction with creating a grid and positioning all elements of the web page. This is a work with styles. It's great if all the elements are arranged by you correctly, but without styles they will look unpresentable. Setting the page background, width and color of icons, creating and distributing style classes and identifiers, prescribing basic properties and additional visual effects are just some of the tasks that a typesetter faces when working with styles.It may seem difficult to a beginner, but to learn all this quickly enough. HTML and CSS are not programming, you don't have to worry too much - just learn the basic rules, tags and properties once and for all and it will stay in your head for a long time. Of course, subject to constant practice.</div>

            <div class="reviews__author">We have already made serious progress. The main part of the work is completed - ours, albeit still imperfect, but already the layout of the site. Making it even better is a further major challenge. From this stage, we begin to actively test our layout in all major browsers. The main thing for us is to see how smoothly and beautifully everything is displayed. If there are no problems, then you can be congratulated. As a rule, you can't do without mistakes, especially if you have a complex layout.Random typos in the code, the lack of cross-browser prefixes for some properties, the use of technologies that have little support - these and other factors can affect the display of the site in different browsers. Typically, most problems occur with older versions of Internet Explorer.Here it is necessary to choose: or in general to spit on display of a site in IE 6-8, or somehow to get out, applying special programs. For example, IE Tester was invented especially for this purpose. The program tests the site in older versions of this browser, showing what it would look like there. There are also special fixes that add support for some elements via JavaScript.</div>

            <div class="reviews__author">Perhaps the self-layout process described above terrifies you, and there is no desire to learn to type. Then you need to use other options. In particular, order a layout from a freelancer or download a ready-made template. The Internet has both templates in pure HTML and CSS, and themes for various CMS. All you have to do is unzip the template and use it for your own purposes.In this article, we looked at three options for how to get the layout. We hope that this knowledge will be useful to you in creating your own or someone else's sites.
